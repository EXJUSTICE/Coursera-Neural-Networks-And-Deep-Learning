# Coursera: Neural Networks and Deep Learning


Instructor: Andrew Ng


This repo contains all all of my jupyter notebooks for this course,  part 1 of 5 out of the Deep Learning Specialization.
All content is for reference purposes only, as the course has a strict honor code.
To understand the mathematics behind the work here, it is suggested to consult Ng's original Machine Learning course in parallel.
